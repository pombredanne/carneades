1. BUILDING THE GUI

In order to build the GUI, you need the JDK 6 and JRE 6 as well as a version of the OpenJFX compiler later than August 18, 2008. You can get the latest compiler via SVN at: https://openjfx-compiler.dev.java.net/

In order for the build.xml file to work correctly, you need to set an environment variable JAVAFXHOME to the root directory of the compiler. Not the bin/-directory, but the one above that contains it. As of now, some deployment tasks will run on unix-like systems ONLY (e.g. Linux, Mac OS, etc.).

There is a number of ant tasks to build the GUI. The tasks below should satisfy most needs. If you are in need of more detailed ones, look up the dependencies in the build.xml file.

"ant" - The default ant target compiles all sources, jars them, packages the web deployment distribution and signs all jar files involved. If the jars are not signed, the application will not start in webstart because of the file loading dialog lacking access rights. In order to provide the requirements for signing, create a keyfile using the standard procedure (http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/deployment/jar/signindex.html), make a local copy of the included "webstart_template.xml" and rename it to "webstart.xml". Open it using text editor and enter the necessary key information into the respective places in the file. The ant file then extracts the information and uses it to sign the jars during the deployment task.

"ant compile" - Compiles all source files.

"ant r" - Runs the GUI locally from the webstart distribution folder. Hence, it needs to be compiler beforehand. This target jars the files and signs the produced jars. If this takes too long for you in case you just want to test something, use "ant rp" below.

"ant rp" - Runs the GUI locally from the webstart distribution. It needs a compiled source before, but jars and copies the libraries itself. Be aware that this target does not sign the involved jars but rather overwrites possibly existing ones with theplain library jars, thereby breaking a previously signed distribution. Hence, use this target for development testing only and always make sure to run a final deployment target that includes signing.

"ant deploy" - This target deploys the webstart distribution (including versioning and updating examples) and signs all jars involved.

2. KNOWN ISSUES

There are a number of issues with the current code as it is. Most of them stem from temporary workarounds for limitations and specificities of the OpenJFX compiler.

3. USED THIRD PARTY LIBRARIES

All used third party libraries are included in this package, so nothing needs to be supplied. All licenses can be found in "<base>/deployment/licenses" Currently, we use:

* OneJar by Simon Tuffs for non-webstart deployment, licensed under its own license. (http://www.simontuffs.com/one-jar)

* SvnTask - Ant task to execute Subversion Commands by Scott Stevens, licensed under the Apache license.

* SVN Kit (as a support for SvnTask) by TMate Software licensed under the TMate Open Source license (http://svnkit.com).

* JarBundler Ant Task for Mac OS X .app deployment by Seth J. Morabito (http://informagen.com/JarBundler/), licensed under the latest GPL.
