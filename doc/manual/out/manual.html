<p>The Carneades Argumentation System is open source software, freely available for downloading at <a href="http://carneades.github.com"><code class="url">http://carneades.github.com</code></a>.</p>
<p>Carneades provides web-based, collaborative software tools for:</p>
<ul>
<li>summarizing the arguments of a debate in an <em>argument graph</em></li>
<li>visualizing, browsing and navigating argument graphs</li>
<li>critically evaluating arguments</li>
<li>forming opinions, participating in polls and ranking stakeholders by the degree to which they share your views</li>
<li>obtaining clear explanations, using argument graphs, of the different effects of alternative policies in particular cases</li>
</ul>
<p>In this manual, we distinguish three kinds of users:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Public Users</dt>
<dd>Users interested in understanding arguments and policies, whom we assume have had <em>no specialist training</em> in argumentation or policy modeling.<br />
</dd>
<dt>Analysts</dt>
<dd>Users who have had <em>specialist training</em> in argumentation or rule-based policy modeling.
</dd>
<dt>System Administrators</dt>
<dd>Users with sufficient computer skills to install, configure and administer the Carneades software.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>These are only roles. Some people may be able to use the system in more than one of these roles. In particular, we aim to make the software simple to install and administer, so that ultimately anyone with basic computer skills will be able to serve as &quot;system administrator&quot;.</p>
<p>The rest of this manual is organized in the following chapters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Argument Graphs</li>
<li>Browsing, Visualizing and Evaluating Arguments</li>
<li>Forming, Polling and Comparing Opinions</li>
<li>Analyzing and Comparing Policies</li>
<li>Editing Argument Graphs</li>
<li>Modeling Policies and Argumentation Schemes</li>
<li>System Administration</li>
<li>Application Scenarios</li>
</ul>
<p>The chapter on argument graphs provides a concise and easy overview of the underlying data model used by all the tools and is recommended to be read first by all users. The next three chapters are for public users and explain how to use the tools for argument browsing, opinion polls and policy analysis, respectively. The chapters on editing argument graphs and modeling policies are for analysts with some prior knowledge of argument reconstruction methods and rule-based systems. The system administration chapter is recommended reading for anyone wishing to install, configure and administer the Carneades software. Finally, the chapter on application scenarios may be of interest to managers and public administrators looking for ways to improve the quality of decision-making processes in their organizations.</p>
<h1 id="argument-graphs"><a href="#TOC"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Argument Graphs</a></h1>
<p>Argument graphs model relationships among arguments, statements and source documents. To build the model, source documents need to be interpreted to find the arguments, in a process called &quot;argument reconstruction&quot;.</p>
<p>Consider the following simple legal argument: Johnny violated the law by riding his skateboard in the park.</p>
<p>This same argument can be expressed in many different ways. Here are some examples:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Because Johnny rode his skateboard in the park he violated the law.</li>
<li>Vehicles are prohibited in the park. Someone who does something which is prohibited violates the law. Johnny rode his skateboard in the park. A skateboard is a vehicle. Therefore Johnny violated the law.</li>
<li>Johnny hat gegen das Gesetz versto√üen, weil er sein Skateboard im Park benutzt hat.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first example just reordered the premise and the conclusion of the argument, putting the premise first. The second example reveals some implicit premises of the original formulation of the argument. The third example is a German translation of the original formulation of the argument.</p>
<p>All four of these texts, including the original formulation, express the <em>same</em> argument, but in different ways. In a large-scale debate, for example about European policy issues, the same argument might be expressed in <em>thousands</em> of different ways in many different languages. (The European Union has 23 official languages.)</p>
<p>One of the purposes of argument graphs is to provide a way to summarize complex debates with exactly one node in the graph for each argument put forward in the debate. A single argument graph is used to represent all the arguments put forward in a debate, from all participants. The nodes can quote one or more source documents, and include links to these source documents, so no information need be lost and all voices can still be heard, inclusively. Grouping the different formulations of an argument together into a single node in the graph, abstracting away details, makes it possible to quickly obtain an overview of the arguments and to obtain a clearer picture of relationships among arguments. A hypertext or map of the source documents directly, without an argument graph, would make it difficult to &quot;see the forest for the trees&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="data-model"><a href="#TOC"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Data Model</a></h2>
<!-- ![Entity-Relationship Diagram](figs/DataModel.png) -->

<p>The entity-relationship diagram above shows the elements of argument graphs and their connections. (The figure does not visualize a particular argument graph, but rather relationships between the elements of argument graphs in general.)</p>
<p>The two main elements of argument graphs are statements and arguments. Statements represent propositions, claims and assertions. Arguments represent simple inferences from one or more premises to a single conclusion. Again, there should be only one statement or argument in the graph for each statement and argument in the source documents, no matter how many different ways the statement or argument has been expressed in source documents. Some or all formulations of the statement or argument can be quoted or referenced in the metadata of the statement or argument node. See the discussion of metadata below for further information.</p>
<p>As can be seen in the entity-relationship diagram, arguments are linked to statements in two ways in argument graphs. Each argument has exactly one conclusion, which is a statement, and zero or more premises, where each premise has exactly one statement node. A statement may the conclusion or premise of more than one argument.</p>
<p>A statement may be both a conclusion and a premise, resulting in complex argument graphs, representing chains or trees of reasoning. Argument graphs may contain cycles. A simple cycle would result if a statement and a premise of the same argument. There are methods for resolving these cycles when evaluating argument graphs.</p>
<p>A statement in an argument graph represents both a proposition and the negation of the proposition. To continue with our example, the sentences &quot;Johnny rode his skateboard in the park&quot; and &quot;Johnny did not ride his skateboard in the park&quot; would be represented by a single statement in an argument graph. Conclusions and premises of argument can negated using con arguments and negative premises, respectively. That is, there are two kinds of arguments, pro and con. An argument is pro if its conclusion claims the statement is true and con if it claims the statement is false. Similarly, there are two kinds of premises, positive and negative. A positive premise holds if its statement is presumably true (&quot;in&quot;). Conversely, a negative premise holds only if its statement is presumably false (&quot;out&quot;).</p>
<p>Prior models of argument graphs do not distinguish pro and con arguments or positive and negative premises. Rather, in these prior approaches all argument nodes are pro and all premises are positive. Our approach has the advantage of reducing the number of statements up to 50%, resulting in more compact summaries of the arguments.</p>

<h2 id="metadata"><a href="#TOC"><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Metadata</a></h2>
<p>The argument graph as as whole, as well as each of its statements and arguments, can be annotated with metadata, using the <a href="http://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a>. There are 15 elements in the Dublin Core. Each element may zero or more values. Here is a list of the Dublin Core elements:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Title</li>
<li>Creator</li>
<li>Subject</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Publisher</li>
<li>Contributor</li>
<li>Date</li>
<li>Type</li>
<li>Format</li>
<li>Identifier</li>
<li>Source</li>
<li>Language</li>
<li>Relation</li>
<li>Coverage</li>
<li>Rights</li>
</ol>
<p>See <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/elements.shtml">Dublin Core</a> for a detailed description and usage guidelines for each element. The Dublin Core is intended to be useful for describing a wide range of &quot;resources&quot; on the World-Wide Web. Not all of the elements may be applicable for argument graphs.</p>
<p>In addition, Carneades allows each metadata record to be assigned an optional &quot;key&quot;, a string which can be used as a label to refer to the metadata record, such as &quot;BenchCapon:2008&quot;, similar to the way citation keys are used in bibliographic databases such as BibTeX.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> At most one key should be provided.</p>
<p>Carneades provides special support for providing description elements of the Dublin Core in multiple languages (English, German, French, ‚Ä¶) and for formatting these descriptions using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> language. This feature can be used to include quotations from and links to source documents in the descriptions of both statements and arguments.</p>
<h1 id="browsing-visualizing-and-evaluating-arguments"><a href="#TOC"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Browsing, Visualizing and Evaluating Arguments</a></h1>

<h2 id="the-argument-graph-home-page"><a href="#TOC"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> The Argument Graph Home Page</a></h2>
<p>The user interface of Carneades is a web application. You access the pages and views of the user interface with web addresses, called Uniform Resource Locators (URL), just like you access any resource on the World-Wide Web. Most of the time you will access the application by clicking on a link embedded in some page on the Web, for example in a news article, blog entry or e-participation web site. If you are using Carneades as a stand-alone, desktop application, these URLs will be local addresses, from the &quot;localhost&quot; domain, pointing to web pages served by the application on your personal computer.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figs/homepage1.png" alt="An Argument Graph Home Page" /><p class="caption">An Argument Graph Home Page</p>
</div>
<p>The home page of an argument graph consists of the following parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <em>title</em> of the argument graph. This title usually includes the topic of the discussion or debate.</p></li>
<li><p>A <em>menu bar</em> of commands. The commands shown depend on the role of the user. Public users, who need not login to the system, are shown the commands &quot;export&quot; and &quot;map&quot;, for exporting the argument graph to XML and viewing an argument map visualization of the graph, respectively. Analysts, who must login to the system with a password, are also shown &quot;new statement&quot; and &quot;new argument&quot; commands. Only analysts may modify the argument graph.</p></li>
<li><p>A <em>description</em> of the topic of the discussion modeled in the argument graph. The description may be available in several languages. The user interface provides a way to select and change your preferred language during the session (<em>not yet implemented</em>). The description can be arbitrarily long and include multiple sections, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, lists and other content.</p></li>
<li><p>A list of the <em>main issues</em> of the discussion. Each item in the list is linked to a page providing detailed information about the statement in the argument graph at issue.</p></li>
<li><p>An <em>outline</em> of the top five levels of the arguments in the argument graph.The first level of the outline lists the main issues (again). The second level lists the arguments pro and con each issue. The third level lists the premises of each of these arguments. The fourth level lists the argument pro and con each premise. Finally, the fifth level lists the premises of these arguments. Deeper levels of the argument graph can be navigated to by first clicking on a statement or argument in the outline and then following the links on the next page. Since argument graphs may contain cycles and are not restricted to trees, some items may appear multiple times in the outline.</p></li>
<li><p>A list of <em>references</em> to the source documents used to construct the argument graph. For documents available on the Web, the reference will include a hyperlink to the source document.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="using-hypertext-to-browse-an-argument-graph"><a href="#TOC"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Using Hypertext to Browse an Argument Graph</a></h2>
<p>There is a web page for each statement and argument in the argument graph providing detailed information about the element along with links to related statements and arguments in the graph. You can use these pages to navigate from node to node in the argument graph, by simply clicking on the links in the usual way. To go back to previous pages, use the back button of your web browser.</p>
<h3 id="statement-pages"><a href="#TOC"><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Statement Pages</a></h3>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figs/statement1.png" alt="A Statement Page" /><p class="caption">A Statement Page</p>
</div>
<p>The top of the statement page displays the properties of the statement: its id, atom, whether or not it is a main issue, its proof standard, usually &quot;pe&quot; (preponderance of the evidence), its weight and value. The other proof standards available are &quot;dv&quot; (dialectical validity), &quot;cce&quot; (clear and convincing evidence), and &quot;brd&quot; (beyond reasonable doubt). See the section on <a href="#evaluating-arguments">Evaluating Arguments</a> for further details about proof standards.</p>
<p>The next section displays the <em>text</em> of the statement. This formulation of the statement is written by the analyst or analysts who reconstructed the arguments to build the argument graph.</p>
<p>If metadata had been provided for the statement, it would be displayed next. Descriptions may be entered, by analysts, in multiple languages. The description, if available, will be displayed using the language chosen by the user. If no description has been entered manually by analysts for the selected language of the user but a description is available in some other language, a translation service will be used to generate a description in the selected language (<em>not yet implemented</em>).</p>
<p>Finally, the statement pages lists pro and con arguments about the statement, i.e. arguments having this statement, or its negation, as a conclusion, as well as arguments which have this statement, or its negation, as a premise. The premises of the pro and con arguments are also listed. This makes it possible to navigate to nearby arguments and statements in the argument graph, by simply clicking on the links in these lists. Use the back button of your web browser to return to this statement page.</p>
<h3 id="argument-pages"><a href="#TOC"><span class="header-section-number">3.2.2</span> Argument Pages</a></h3>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figs/argument1.png" alt="An Argument Page" /><p class="caption">An Argument Page</p>
</div>
<p>Argument pages are quite similar to statement pages. The top of an argument page displays the properties of the argument: its id, the argumentation scheme applied (if any), whether it is a strict or defeasible argument, its weight and value. The argumentation scheme contains a hyperlink (<em>not yet implemented</em>). Click on the link to view a description of the scheme.</p>
<p>If metadata had been provided for the argument, it would be displayed next. Descriptions can include quotations of one or more source texts expressing the argument, along with hyperlinks to the sources on the Web. The description, if available, will be displayed using the language chosen by the user. If no description has been entered manually by analysts for the selected language of the user but a description is available in some other language, a translation service will be used to generate a description in the selected language (<em>not yet implemented</em>).</p>
<p>Next, the premises of the argument are listed. If available, the role of each premise in the argumentation scheme applied is shown (e.g. &quot;major&quot; or &quot;minor&quot;). The check boxes to the left of each premise are used to indicate whether the statement is current <em>in</em> (checked box, meaning presumably true), <em>out</em> (crossed out box, meaning presumably false) or neither (empty box, not enough information to presume either truth or falsity), given the arguments in the graph and the opinions of users from polls about the acceptability of statements and relative weights of pro and con arguments.</p>
<p>After the premises, the conclusion of the argument is shown, preceded by &quot;pro&quot; or &quot;con&quot;, showing the direction of the argument, and a check box showing the acceptability of the conclusion, as for the premises.</p>
<p>Finally, a list of counterarguments is shown.<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> The premises of the counterarguments arguments are also listed. This makes it possible to navigate to nearby arguments and statements in the argument graph, by simply clicking on the links in these lists. You can use the back button of your web browser to return to this argument page.</p>
<h2 id="visualizing-argument-graphs-in-argument-maps"><a href="#TOC"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Visualizing Argument Graphs in Argument Maps</a></h2>
<p>The menus of the argument graph home page, statement pages and argument maps include a &quot;map&quot; button. Clicking on the &quot;map&quot; button generates a diagram, called an &quot;argument map&quot;, which visualizes the argument graph as a network (directed graph) of statement nodes and argument nodes connected by links. Statement nodes are shown as boxes; argument nodes with circles and boxes with rounded corners.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figs/map1.png" alt="An Argument Map" /><p class="caption">An Argument Map</p>
</div>
<p>For statement nodes, the text of the statement is shown inside the box, possibly truncated if the text is too long. In argument nodes, the circle is filled with a plus sign, if the argument is a pro argument, or a minus sign, for con arguments. The edges (links) between argument nodes and statement nodes show the premises and conclusion of the argument. The conclusion of the argument is the statement node pointed to by the edge with the normal arrowhead. The other statement nodes linked to the argument, without arrowheads, are its premises. Negative premises are displayed with a circular (dot) arrowhead on the statement side of the edge.</p>
<p>The statement and argument nodes in argument maps contain hyperlinks. Clicking on a statement or argument node displays the details of the node in a statement or argument page, respectively.</p>
<p>In argument maps, argument nodes whose conclusion is another argument node, rather than a statement node, visualize &quot;undercutting&quot; arguments. These are arguments which question the applicability of another argument. This is the only case where two nodes of the same time are directly connected in the map.</p>
<p>Argument maps are represented using structured vector graphics (SVG) not bitmaps. You can zoom the map in or out, to any scale, without loss of resolution. How this zooming is done depends on your device and web browser.</p>
<p>When argument graphs have been evaluated, the status of the argument and statement nodes is visualized in argument maps using both color and icons. Nodes which are &quot;in&quot; are filled with a green background and contain a checked box. Nodes which are &quot;out&quot; are shown with a red background and contain a crossed box (a box filled with an X). Nodes which are neither in nor out are filled with white background color and contain an empty checkbox. The colors are redundant to accommodate black and white printing and color-blind users.</p>
<p>Argument graphs may contain cycles. However, currently the algorithm used to layout the argument and statement nodes in the map is not able to handle cycles. <em>This limitation will be removed in a later version of the system.</em></p>
<p>Argument graphs can be very large. Currently the <em>entire</em> argument graph is displayed in the argument maps. In the future only a partial view of the argument graph in maps will be shown, at least for larger graphs. The part of the graph shown will depend on the context. The map generated from the home page of the argument graph will show the arguments and statements near the main issues of the map. The maps generated from statement and argument pages will show the part of the argument graph near the selected statement or argument. A method for scrolling the maps, to bring other parts of the graph into view, will be provided.</p>
<h2 id="searching-for-arguments"><a href="#TOC"><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Searching for Arguments</a></h2>
<p>The argument graph home page will provide access to a command for searching for arguments.</p>
<p><strong>Not yet implemented</strong></p>
<h2 id="evaluating-arguments"><a href="#TOC"><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Evaluating Arguments</a></h2>
<p>By argument &quot;evaluation&quot; we mean the process of critically assessing arguments by</p>
<ul>
<li>revealing implicit premises</li>
<li>validating whether the arguments are formally correct, by instantiating accepted argumentation schemes</li>
<li>asking appropriate critical questions, depending on the schemes applied</li>
<li>and determining which claims are acceptable, taking into consideration the assumptions of the users and their collective assessment of the relative weights of conflicting pro and con arguments.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first three of these tasks can be accomplished by comparing the argument with its argumentation scheme. On the argument page, click on the argumentation scheme to view a description of the scheme (<em>not yet implemented</em>). Most web browsers provide some way to open the link in a new tab, so that you can easily switch back and forth between the argument page and the description of the scheme. Now you can check whether any of the premises listed in the scheme are missing from the argument. The argument is formally valid if all the premises of the scheme are explicitly provided by matching premises of the argument and the conclusion of the argument matches the conclusion of the scheme.</p>
<p>Argumentation schemes define exceptions and assumptions which can be used to ask critical questions. The exceptions provide reasons for not applying the argument, undercutting it. If an exception is true, this doesn't mean that the conclusion of the argument is false, but only that the argument does not provide a good reason to presume the conclusion to be true. The assumptions of the scheme are implicit premises which need to be proven only if they are called into question. So, if you think an assumption does not hold, you should consider making an issue of it using whatever channels are available for you for participating in the discussion. (The Carneades system does not provide this service. Its function is to provide a tool for summarising and understanding arguments, wherever they take place.)</p>
<p>The assumptions of the users and their collective assessment of the relative weights of conflicting pro and con arguments are collected and aggregated using the opinion polling tool described in the <a href="#formulating-polling-and-comparing-opinions">opinion polling</a> chapter of this manual. At any time, an analyst can execute the &quot;evaluate&quot; command, shown in the menu bars of the argument graph home page, and the statement and argument pages, to compute the acceptability of the arguments and statements in the argument graph, on the basis of the information gathered from users via the polls. A statement is considered acceptable if the users <em>should</em> believe it to be true given only the arguments modelled in the argument graph and their own assumptions and assessment of the relative weights of these arguments.</p>
<p>If you do not agree with the result of the evaluation, there are at least three reasons why you may be right and the system's evaluation wrong:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Not all relevant arguments have been included in the model, or put forward in the debate. If you are aware of some missing argument, consider contributing it to the discussion yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>The collective, averaged opinion of the users who participated in the poll may be incorrect. Minority views can be correct. If you haven't yet participated in the poll, you may want to do so now.</p></li>
<li><p>The formal model of argument we are we are using to compute acceptability, based on the state of the art of the field of computational models of argument, may be incorrect. Of course, specialist knowledge is required to assess the correctness of the model. If you, like most people, do not have this knowledge, then we recommend a skeptical but respectful attitude. If you agree with the results of the model, then the model gives you a reason to have more confidence in your opinion. If you do not agree with the results of the model, then you may want to take pause to reconsider your views, even if in the end you do not change your mind.</p></li>

<h2 id="exporting-argument-graphs-to-xml"><a href="#TOC"><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Exporting Argument Graphs to XML</a></h2>
<p>The menu bar of the argument graph home page and the statement and argument pages includes an &quot;export&quot; button. Click on this button to generate an XML file containing all the data and metadata in the argument graph, including quotations of and links to source documents.</p>
<p>The XML files use a schema called the &quot;Carneades Argument Format&quot; (CAF), documented elsewhere. (* To do: write the CAF documentation*)</p>
<p>These XML files can be used to transfer argument graphs from one installation of the Carneades system to another, to merge argument graphs from several sources, to archive argument graphs, or to translate argument graphs into other formats, such as the <a href="http://www.arg.dundee.ac.uk/aif">Argument Interchange Format</a> (AIF), or the generate reports or other kinds of visualisations..</p>
