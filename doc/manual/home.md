# The Carneades Home Page

The Carneades home page provides an overview of the features and tools of the system along with the main menu for accessing these tools.  The main menu is always available, on every page of the Carneades system, to make it easy to navigate directly from one tool to another at any time.

The items in the main menu are:

- Home
- Argument Graph
- Poll
- Policy Analysis
- System Administration

The "Home" menu item takes you back the home page, described here.  

The "Argument Graph" menu item takes you a description of the debate and a hypertext outline of the argument graph model of the debate.  The argument graph page includes a submenu of commands for generating  argument maps, evaluating arguments, viewing argumentation schemes, exporting argument maps to XML and, if you are logged in as an analyst, for editing the argument graph.

The "Poll" menu item takes you to the opinion formation, polling and comparison tool, where you can moderate a virtual debate of the issues. In return, you will receive a guided tour of the issues and arguments, to help you to formulate your own opinion. The tool also provides you with a way anonymously share your opinion with other users. The polling results are aggregated by the system and used to help you to evaluate the acceptability of claims. Finally, the tool compares your opinions with the opinions expressed in the published documents used to create the argument graph, for example the opinions of political parties, and ranks the authors by the degree to which their opinions agree with yours. 

The "Policy Analysis" menu item takes you to a tool for analyzing and comparing the effects of various policy proposals on example cases. In a dialog with the system, you will be asked a serious of questions to gather information about a real or hypothetical case. An argument graph will be generated, by applying the rules of the policy proposals to the facts of the case, showing how the various policies would work in the given case. The tool can help you to find the policies which best serve your interests. Here too your privacy is protected. Care is taken to not request or store information that could be used to reveal your identity.  

Finally, the "System Adminstration" menu item takes you to a page for managing and configuring the Carneades server.  You will need to log in with a user name and password. Here you can create, edit, archive and delete projects, where each project consists of an argument graph, a set of argumentation schemes, models of proposed policies, the test cases and possibly local copies of source documents.

The current project, the one being accessed and used from the user interface, is identified by a parameter in the Web address (URL)  used to access the system. Only system administrators have access to the list of all projects served by a particular installation of the Carneades system.
