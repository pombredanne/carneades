# Applications Scenarios

This chapter presents a number of application scenarios illustrating *some* ways the Carneades argumentation system can be used in practice to:

- improve the quality, efficiency, inclusiveness and transparency of democratic public policy deliberations,
- improve the efficiency and correctness of claims processing procedures both in public administration and the private sector, for example with regard to social benefits or insurance claims.
- better manage complex legal cases in law firms, by creating maps of relationships between claims, legal arguments, case and statute citations, and testimonial and documentary evidence, and
- facilitate the learning of critical thinking and analysis skills, particularly in law, philosophy, religion and other humanities fields, where competing theories are constructed by interpreting texts.

## Public Policy Deliberations

For some years now there has been considerable discussion and research on "e-democracy" or "e-participation", about ways to use the Internet and, in particular, the World-Wide Web to revitalize democracy, overcome political apathy and improve the quality, inclusiveness and transparency of governance and policy-making. The first generation of e-participation systems were customized versions of various kinds of collaborative software ("groupware"), such as discussion forums, polls, and wikis. More recently there have been attempts to leverage existing social networks, such as Facebook, Google+ and Twitter for e-participation purposes. While these approaches provide ways for citizens to voice their concerns and provide input to the policy-making process, they do not scale well as the level of participation increases. Imagine a EU-wide policy discussion, with 27 states, 23 official languages, and over 500 million citizens. 

Carneades complements existing e-participation and other social media platforms by helping citizens, and government officials, to obtain a concise overview of the substance of the policy debates taking place on these platforms. Carneades can make it easier to identify and understand the issues, proposed policies, the pros and cons of these policies and the collective assessment of stakeholders about the truth of claims and the relative importance or weight of conflicting considerations.

Imagine the following application scenario, which uses Carneades to support  wide-scale deliberations, such as the 2008 deliberations of the [European Green Paper](http://europa.eu/documentation/official-docs/green-papers/index_en.htm)  on [Copyright in the Knowledge Economy](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2008:0466:FIN:EN:PDF):

1. The EU publishes the Green Paper, in PDF, on its web site and invites stakeholders, such as libraries and publishers, but also "ordinary" citizens, to submit comments by uploading a PDF file to the site.
2. The EU publishes the comments on their web site, as they are received.
3. In parallel, the issues raised in the Green Paper are discussed informally across the Internet, in discussion forums, on social networks, in online newspaper or blog articles, and in comments on these articles.
4. As the discussion proceeds, trained analysts employed by the EU, either as regular staff or as free-lancers, use Carneades to reconstruct the arguments in a representive sample of the source documents, including both officially submitted comments and articles found elsewhere on the Internet, to build an argument graph.
5. In parallel, [data-driven journalists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_driven_journalism), hired by media companies and NGOs, can use Carneades to construct their own, competing argument graphs of the debate to be offered as value-added content on the Web.
6. The argument graphs constructed by the analysts and data-journalists are published on the Web, providing citizens with  high-level overviews of the ongoing-debate along with references (links) to source documents. The references enable anyone to check the accuracy and completeness of the argument graphs and provide easy access to further, more detailed information. 
7. For policy proposals which are detailed enough to be modeled as rules, the EU analysts can use Carneades to create and publish policy models enabling stakeholders to evaluate the effects of each policy on the cases which interest them. Users could contribute, via the web site, benchmark cases they think require special consideration and share these cases with others on the Web.
8. After sufficient time has passed to allow for an in-depth discussion of the issues and the reconstruction of the arguments in an argument graph, the opinion formation and polling tool of Carneades is use to obtain informed feedback from citizens about their opinions of the claims and arguments. The questions asked in the poll are generated automatically from the argument graph. Several polls can be conducted, at regular intervals, depending on the duration of the offical EU procedure for the public deliberation of the Green Paper.
9. At the end of the discussion period, the EU analysts use Carneades to generate an outline of the results of the deliberation which can be processed further using word processing software.
