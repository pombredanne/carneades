# Getting Started

The Carneades Argumentation System is open source software, freely
available for downloading at <http://carneades.github.com>.

Carneades provides web-based, collaborative software tools for:

- summarizing the arguments of a debate in an *argument graph*
- visualizing, browsing and navigating argument graphs
- critically evaluating arguments
- formulating opinions and participating in polls, and 
- constructing clear explanations, using argument graphs, of the
  different effects of alternative policies in particular cases.
  
In this manual, we distinguish three kinds of users:

Public Users.
:   Users interested in understanding arguments and policies, whom we assume have had *no specialist training* in argumentation or policy modeling.  
Analysts.
:   Users who have had *specialist training* in argumentation or rule-based policy modelling.
System Administrators.
:   Users with sufficient computer skills to install, configure and administer the Carneades software.
  
These are only roles. Some people may be able to use the system in
more than one of these roles.  In particular, we aim to make the
software simple to install and administer, so that ultimately anyone
with basic computer skills will be able to serve as "system
administrator".

The rest of this manual is organized in the following chapters:

- Browsing, Viewing and Evaluating Arguments
- Formulating Opinions and Participating in Polls
- Analysing and Comparing Policies
- Constructing and Editing Argument Graphs
- Modeling Policies and Argumentation Schemes
- System Administration

The first three of these chapters should be of interest to all users.
The chapters on constructing argument graphs and modeling policies are
for analysts with the requisite background knowledge of argument
reconstruction methods and rule-based systems. The system
administration chapter is recommended reading for anyone wishing to
install and administer the Carneades software.
