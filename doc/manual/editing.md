# Editing Argument Graphs

To edit an argument graph, first go to the argument graph page, as described in the Chapter entitled [Browsing, Visualizing and Evaluating Arguments](#browsing-visualizing-evaluating-arguments).

You can add nodes to the graph by clicking on the "New Statement" or "New Argument" buttons in the menu bar.  In both cases you will be presented with a form to enter the required information.  The form will be inserted and displayed at the top of the current argument graph page, so that you can scroll down to view information about the argument graph, without having to toggle back and forth between two tabs or  pages in your web browser.

	You can use the *description* field to provide whatever information you want about the argument. The description can include headers,  lists, quotations, hypertext links and other elements, using the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) wiki language. The form includes a Markdown editor to make this easier for you.
