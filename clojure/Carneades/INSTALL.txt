These installation instructions are for the Carneades inference engine,
implemented in the Clojure programming language.

1. Prerequisites

- The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 6 <http://java.sun.com/>
- Leiningen <http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen>

2. Downloading Carneades

Alternatively, the sources can be downloaded using either the SVN or the Bazaar source code management system:

	$ svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/carneades/trunk
	$ bzr branch lp:~vcs-imports/carneades/trunk

3. Installation

- First create a directory for the sources.  We'll refer to this

environment variable with this name.)

- Change directory to CARNEADES_HOME.

- Unpack the zip file in this directory.

- Change directory to CARNEADES_HOME/clojure/Carneades

- Run lein deps:

$ lein deps

4. Trying it out

- Run the tests

And then type, for instance to test the Pierson-Post example:

(use 'carneades.examples.piersonspost)
