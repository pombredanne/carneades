1. Prerequisites

- PLT Scheme <http://www.plt-scheme.org>
- GraphViz <http://www.graphviz.org/>

Both are free software, available in Mac/Unix/Windows versions.

2. Downloading Carneades

Carneades is available for downloading as a compressed (.zip) file from
<http://carneades.berlios.de>.  Alternatively, the sources can be
downloaded using the SVN source code management system, following the
instructions avaiable here
<http://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=9385>.

3. Installation

- If you downloaded the .zip file distribution of Carneades, first
unpack this .zip file in the directory/folder of your choice.  If you
used SVN to download Carneades, you will have downloaded them into a
directory.   No matter which method you used, in the following we will
refer to the directory containing the Carneades sources as
"CARNEADES_HOME".  (You do not need to create an environment variable
with this name.)

The CARNEADES_HOME directory should contain these files and directories:

- CHANGES.txt 
- INSTALL.txt 
- examples 
- src 
- schemas

The Scheme source files of Carneades are in the "src/carneades"
directory.

Start DrScheme and excecute the following command to find out the full
paths of the directories searched for collections (i.e. libraries):

> (current-library-collection-paths )

Create a symbolic link in one of the directories listed to the directory
containing the source code of the Carneades.  For example, using a Unix
operating system this can be done as follows from a Unix shell, such as Bash.
Let COLLECTS be the path of a directory in the current library collections path.

$ cd COLLECTS
$ ln -s CARNEADES_HOME/src/carneades carneades

Be sure to replace "COLLECTS" and "CARNEADES_HOME" with the full path names
of the actual directories.

Warning: You may need to repeat this installation procedure if you later 
upgrade your installation of PLT to a new version, since each version of PLT 
Scheme has its own directories for storing collections.

4. Configuration

- In the src/carneades directory, edit the config.scm file to select your
preferred graphics format for displaying argument graphs (png, ps, or
svg) and specify the full path to some application for viewing graphics
in this format.  The config.scm file includes some examples for both
Windows and Mac OS X.


5. Trying it out

- Start DrScheme 
- In the "examples" directory, open the "rule-tests.scm" file 
- Click on the "Run" button in the upper-right corner of the window 
  to run some tests 
- Try out the example commands commented out near the end of the file, 
  to see how to ask queries and show a diagram of the arguments found.

Note: You will need to quit the graphics application to return control
to PLT Scheme.
