sct_intro=This is the structured consultation tool. The tool serves two \
purposes: \
\n \
\n  - It guides you step by step through the arguments on all sides of a \
complex policy debate, providing you with an overview of the issues, \
positions and arguments in a systematic way. The tool can help you to \
form your own opinion, if you don't yet have one, or to critically \
evaluate and reconsider your preexisting opinion, if you do. The tool \
also enables you to compare your responses with published positions of \
some stakeholders, such as the official positions of political \
parties. This can help you to find persons and organizations which \
best represent or share your views and interests. \
\n \
\n  - At the same time the tool conducts a survey to collect your views \
and opinions on the issues, taking care to protect your privacy. The \
anonymous and aggregated results of the survey can provide valuable \
feedback to policy makers, going beyond the information provided by \
traditional surveys.  It enables policy makers to discover not only \
how much support policies enjoy, but also to learn precisely why \
particular aspects of the policies, or their underlying assumptions, \
are supported or not. \

When using the structured consultation tool, you will be guided \
through the following steps: \
\n \
\n \
1. Login using a pseudonym to protect your privacy. You can login \
again using this name to change your responses at any time. \
\n \
2. Read an introduction to the topic of the debate and select an issue \
of interest. \
\n \
3. Answer a series of survey questions about the selected issue. The \
system will inform you about your progess and estimate the remaining \
number of questions. The precise number of questions may vary, as the \
order and number of questions depends on your answers to prior \
questions. You decide how deep to delve into the issues and can \
control how much time to spend answering questions. \
\n \
4. View a summary of the questions and your reponses, and provide you \
with an opportunity to change any of your answers. \
\n \
5. Rank stakeholders, such as political parties, by how much they \
agree or disagree with your views on the issues. \
\n\
\n\
This procedure is flexible and you are in control. You can stop at any \
time, and continue later if you'd like, or jump backwards or forwards \
to any step in the procedure.   \
