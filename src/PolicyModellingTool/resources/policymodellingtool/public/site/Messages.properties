sct_purpose_intro=This is the structured consultation tool. The tool serves two purposes:

sct_first_purpose=It guides you step by step through the arguments on all sides of a complex policy debate, providing you with an overview of the issues, positions and arguments in a systematic way. The tool can help you to form your own opinion, if you don't yet have one, or to critically evaluate and reconsider your preexisting opinion, if you do. The tool also enables you to compare your responses with published positions of some stakeholders, such as the official positions of political parties. This can help you to find persons and organizations which best represent or share your views and interests.

sct_second_purpose=At the same time the tool conducts a survey to collect your views and opinions on the issues, along with those of other stakeholders, taking care to protect your privacy. The anonymous and aggregated results of the survey can provide valuable feedback to policy makers, going beyond the information provided by traditional surveys.  It enables policy makers to discover not only how much support policies enjoy, but also to learn precisely why particular aspects of the policies, or their underlying assumptions, are supported or not.

sct_steps_intro=When using the structured consultation tool, you will be guided through the following steps:
sct_step_1=Login using a pseudonym to protect your privacy. You can login again using this name to change your responses at any time.
sct_step_2=Read an introduction to the topic of the debate.
sct_step_3=Select an issue of interest.
sct_step_4=Answer a series of survey questions about the selected issue. The system will inform you about your progess and estimate the remaining number of questions. The precise number of questions may vary, as the order and number of questions depends on your answers to prior questions. You decide how deep to delve into the issues and can control how much time to spend answering questions.
sct_step_5=If you want, return to step 3 to select another issue to investigate.
sct_step_6=View a summary of the questions and your reponses, and provide you with an opportunity to change any of your answers.
sct_step_7=View a comparison of your answers with those of stakeholders who have publicly expressed their positions on these issues.
sct_procedure=This procedure is flexible and you are in control. You can stop at any time, or jump backwards or forwards to some other step whenever you want. Or you can just let the tool can guide you, step by step, through the procedure. Begin by entering a username and then clicking on the "start" button below.
sct_login_instruction=Please enter a username (a pseudonym, not your real name). If you are a returning user, you can use your previous username to view and modify your prior survey answers. Choose a cryptic name if you want to reduce the chance of other users viewing or changing your responses.
sct_username=Username:
sct_username_placeholder=Please do not use your real name.
