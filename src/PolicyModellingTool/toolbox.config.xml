<!-- We agreed to have a big config file for all tools in the toolbox, which 
	is how the toolbox accesses the tools.Each tool must provide a relative path 
	to its javascript file, which contains the init method. The init method contains 
	all the dependencies that are to be loaded and the path to the css files. 
	The name and id of the tool. The id is used by the toolbox to create an HTML 
	div, to create a sandbox for the tool. -->
