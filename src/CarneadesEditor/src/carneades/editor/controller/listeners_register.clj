;; For the seperation of concerns, we follow here the MVC pattern,

;; This namespace directly access the GUI to register Swing listeners and
;; dispatch the calls in an UI-independent way to the listeners in listeners.clj
;;
;; This is the only namespace, with the swing-listeners,
;; that should be given direct access to the Swing UI and only through
;; the SwingUI protocol.
;;
;; All other accesses must be made within listeners.clj
;; and only through the View protocol.
;;
;; This allow to keep the model and the listeners logic independant
;; from the specific Swing GUI implementation.
