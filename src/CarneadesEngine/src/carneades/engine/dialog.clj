(ns ^{:doc "Save questions and answers of the dialog between the
  engine and the user (when using ask.clj). 

  Essentially, the ask component provides a tool for the user to define
  a table for each askable predicate. Each row in the table represents
  a statement node, including its weight, where weight=1.0 if the
  statement has been accepted as true, 0.0 if the statement has been
  rejected as false, and 0.5 otherwise. Notice that negative
  statements can be included in the table, by setting their weights to
  0.0.

  The ask component returns a sequence of responses, implementing the
  ArgumentGenerator protocol. If the weight of the statement is 1.0 in
  the table, a singelton response is returned, with the statement as a
  positive assumption. The the weight of the statement in the table is
  0.0, a singleton response is returned, with the negation of the
  statement as an assumption. Otherwise the query fails by returning an
  empty sequence. "} carneades.engine.dialog
