            :description {:en "The purpose of the [Green Paper](http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/copyright-infso/greenpaper_en.pdf) on “Copyright in the Knowledge Economy” is to “foster a debate on how knowledge for research, science 
and education can best be disseminated in the online environment.” [@GreenPaper, p. 3].

The Green Paper has two parts.  The first deals with general issues and the second deals with “specific issues related to the exceptions
and limitations which are most relevant for the dissemination of knowledge and whether these exceptions should evolve
in the era of digital dissemination.” [@GreenPaper, p. 3].

Here, we present a reconstruction of some of the policies and arguments put forward in the comments submitted in reponse to the Green Paper.
Our aim is not to comprehensively model all the policies and arguments submitted, but rather to model a sufficient number of
representative arguments and policies for the purpose of illustrating features of the IMPACT argument toolbox.

The Corpus Selection Working Group of the IMPACT project has chosen 4 of the 25 questions raised in the Green Paper, as well as
12 of the 323 comments submitted, representing a wide range of stakeholders, to be used for the research and development purposes of the project.

The four questions covered by this model are listed below.  Click on a question for further information."}

> Researchers and students increasingly work in more than one Member State, successively or concurrently. The patchy availability of the exceptions makes their work difficult, because what is lawful in one country (for example copying a small portion of a work for critical illustration) is probably unlawful in another. This is particularly the case at Aston where there are opportunities for students to work in a variety of countries on placement and therefore could potentially experience a range of legislation. We also welcome students on exchange from various countries.The situation is made worse by the provision in most Member States that contracts, governing the use of digital material, automatically override statute law. The supremacy of contracts means that statutory exceptions are probably unavailable even in the State that enacted them. This is potentially confusing for users of copyright material as well as information professionals supporting them, where detailed knowledge of specific contracts is required. It is vital that the research and teaching community in Higher Education the right to use copyright material in the context of ‘fair dealing’ to ensure that academics, librarians and other information professionals are not tied up with recording and monitoring activity within a regulatory framework which is already complex. This situation of legal uncertainty needs legislative action by the European institutions. [@Aston2008, p. 1]

The Action Alliance for Copyright in Education and Science formulated this argument as follows:

> Different copyright exceptions have always been a hindrance for international, cross-border science and resarch. Binding harmoninzed copryight exceptions for all Member States are therefore desirable. [@Aktionsbündnis, p. 5]"
                                :de "Aston Universität argumentiert wie folgt:

> Forscher und Studenten zunehmend in mehr als einem Mitgliedstaat zu arbeiten, nacheinander oder gleichzeitig. Die lückenhafte Verfügbarkeit der Ausnahmen macht ihre Arbeit schwierig, weil, was in einem Land rechtmäßig (z. B. Kopieren von einem kleinen Teil eines Werkes für kritische Grafik) wahrscheinlich rechtswidrig in ein anderes. Dies ist insbesondere der Fall bei Aston in denen es Möglichkeiten für Studenten, um in einer Vielzahl von Ländern zur Platzierung der Arbeit und damit potenziell Erfahrung eine Reihe von Rechtsvorschriften. Wir begrüßen auch Schüler zum Austausch aus verschiedenen Ländern. Die Situation wird durch die Bereitstellung in den meisten Mitgliedstaaten, dass die Verträge, die die Verwendung von digitalem Material, automatisch überschreiben Gesetzesrecht gemacht. Die Überlegenheit der Verträge bedeutet, dass die gesetzlichen Ausnahmen wahrscheinlich nicht zur Verfügung stehen, auch in dem Staat, der sie erlassen. Das ist verwirrend für die Nutzer von urheberrechtlich geschütztem Material sowie Informationen Profis unterstützen sie, wo genaue Kenntnis der spezifischen Vertrügen erforderlich ist. Es ist wichtig, dass die Forschung und Lehre Gemeinde in Higher Education das Recht vor, urheberrechtlich geschütztes Material im Rahmen der ‘Fair Dealing’ verwenden, um die Wissenschaftler, Bibliothekare und andere Informationsspezialisten sicher nicht mit Aufzeichnung und Überwachung Aktivität in einem Rechtsrahmen gebunden, die ist schon komplex. Diese Situation der Rechtsunsicherheit muss legislative Maßnahmen der europäischen Institutionen. [@Aston2008, S. 1]

Scanning is a form of copying which requires the authorization of the copyright owner.  No court has ever held otherwise.

The Software and Information Industry (SIIA) formulated this argument as follows in its comment:

> Scanning of copyright works is a form of copying and as such is generally prohibited under the Berne Convention and copyright laws of countries around the globe unless the copier has first 
obtained the copyright owner’s authorization to scan the work(s).  The ultimate purpose of the 
scanning  -- e.g., for indexing, cataloguing, searching or some other purpose -- should have no 
bearing on the ultimate determination that a copy is being made and that such activity requires 
the authorization of the copyright owner.  As a result, any public or private initiative to scan 
entire collections of works must require that the copyright owner opt-in, rather than putting the 
onus on the copyright owner to opt-out of the initiative.  We do not believe that there needs to be 
any further clarification in the law in this area.  To the best of our knowledge no court has ever 
held that such large-scale scanning activities are not prohibited under copyright law. [@SIIA, p. 7]"}

This position was formulated by the Sofware and Information Industry Association (SIIA) as follows:

> The issue of user-created content is primarily one of education.  Until recently,
most people did not have the capability to use someone else’s creation to create a new work.
Copying was too difficult or expensive.  As a result, your average person did not need to have
even a rudimentary understanding of copyright rules.  But now, anyone can be a publisher.
It’s easy and inexpensive.  While this presents great new possibilities, it also poses great
challenges and risks for copyright owners.  Governments and educators need to do a better job
educating the public on what they can and cannot do with copyrighted works.  The public needs to better understand the purpose and goals of the copyright law and the sanctions for violating it.
In short, the rules of the road do not need to be changed, the people who drive on the road
need to better understand the rules. [@SIIA, pp. 15-16.]"}
